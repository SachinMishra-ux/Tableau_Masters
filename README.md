## 📝 Why this Course Structure

- A README (or “read-me”) is often the first thing a visitor sees — it helps them understand the scope, content, and how to use a repository effectively. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Dividing content into clear modules/topics makes learning structured and easier to navigate — especially when the course spans many Tableau concepts from beginner to advanced.  
- Including sample datasets + prepared exercises ensures hands-on learning: theory + practice go hand in hand.  
- Emphasizing LOD (Level of Detail) and aggregation control helps build deep understanding of how Tableau computes and aggregates data — a critical skill for advanced analyses. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
